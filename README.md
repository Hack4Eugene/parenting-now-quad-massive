# parenting-now-quad-massive

This is Josiah Youngs solution to Parenting Now's Hack 4 A Cause Challenge.

This solution uses Google App Scripts integrated and "bound" to the template Google Document to select a source Google Spreadsheet report of a specific custom format and use it to populate field information on the resulting Google Document for form purposes.

To use either: 

a) either copy a already set up document (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1oSqM1hnt4r1VZFFyfcKtwm4Xfd-j1UciAMu7asGD_8E)

or 

b) copy Code.gs and Picker.html from the Google App Scripts directory (https://github.com/Hack4Eugene/parenting-now-quad-massive/tree/master/Google%20App%20Scripts) into the bound Google Drive Script Editor Environment and authenticate project access to run.

Then reload the Google Drive Document and use the "Parenting Now"->"Populate from report" menu item.

Authenticate the project if nessasary.

Then select the report spreadsheet source.

This will populate the form fields.

Thanks and have a great day!
